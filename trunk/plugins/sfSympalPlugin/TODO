## 1.0

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Performance

#### Eliminate Joins

* Cache sfSympalContentType data so we do not need to join it on content and menu item queries
* Cache Site record for application and remove Site join from menu and content queries
* Add denormalized cache for list of groups on content record and menu items to avoid m2m joins to retrieve groups

#### Possibilities?

* Test if loading content slots in another query is faster than left joining them in the main query.

### New Documentation Chapters

### I18N

Missing translations:

* "Save Order >>" in nested set editor
