These tests cover various important aspects of Swift Mailer.

For those of you who aren't seriously into testing, you'll probably just
want to run the smoke tests since these are visual tests with graphics and
all you need to do is compare the results.  There are also some benchmarks, and some
unit tests included.

BEFORE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING, YOU MUST SET UP THE TEST ENVIRONMENT

Setting up the test environment
-------------------------------

YOU NEED SIMPLETEST INSTALLED SOMEWHERE ALREADY FOR THE UNITS!

1.  CHMOD tests/tmp/ to be writable to the web user:

- $  chmod 0777 ./tests/tmp

2.  Extract the files in tests/files/extract_these_first.tar.bz2  used as pretend attachments:

- $  cd ./tests/files
- $  tar xvjf extract_these_first.tar.bz2

3.  Edit the TestConfiguration.php file.  It contains things such as the simpletest path
    and addresses to use in sending for the smoke tests.


Running the Smoke Tests
-------------------------

The smoke tests are easy.  They're just visual tests.  Simply open up the files in test/smokes/
in your web browser and follow the instructions on the screen.

Running the Unit Tests
-----------------------

The unit tests require you to have simpletest installed.

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/simpletest/

Ope the tests/units/runTests.php file in your web browser, then select test cases, or a group of tests from the left.

A green bar indicates everything is ok.  A red bar indicates a failure.

Running the Benchmarks
------------------------

YOU NEED THE XDEBUG2 PHP EXTENSION TO RUN THE BENCHMARKS

There are 3 benchmark files included in tests/benchmarks/.  These will actually send emails
to the addresses given in the TestConfiguration.php files.

If you don't have Xdebug2 installed, you can get it from PECL using:

- $  pecl install xdebug-2.0.0RC3


 - End of file -
