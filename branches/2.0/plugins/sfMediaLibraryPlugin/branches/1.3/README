sfMediaLibrary plugin
=====================

The `sfMediaLibraryPlugin` provides an easy-to-use interface to manage web
assets (images, PDF documents, Flash objects, and so on).

Installation
------------

To install the plugin for a symfony project, the usual process is to use the
symfony command line:

    $ php symfony plugin:install sfMediaLibraryPlugin

As the plugin contains some assets, run the `plugin:publish-assets` task:

    $ php symfony plugin:publish-assets

Enable the `sfMediaLibrary` module in your application, via the `settings.yml`
file:

    [yml]
    // in apps/APP_NAME/config/settings.yml
    all:
      .settings:
      enabled_modules: [default, sfMediaLibrary]

Start using the new module by making a request to:

    http://myproject/frontend_dev.php/sfMediaLibrary

By default, all uploaded files are stored in the `uploads/assets/` directory
under the `web/` directory.

You can customize this directory by changing the `upload_dir/` setting in
`app.yml` (you must provide a relative path to the `web/` directory):

    [yml]
    all:
      sf_media_library:
        upload_dir: media

In the above example, uploaded files will be in the `web/media/` directory.

The `sfMediaLibrary` module
---------------------------

The module allows for the upload, renaming and deletion of all types of files
(image, pdf, spreadsheet, etc). Click on an asset name to rename it, click on
the trashcan icon to delete it.

You can create, rename and delete subdirectories as well, resulting in a real
tree structure that will keep your media assets organized.

The module is fully i18n'ed, and the plugin comes with English, French,
Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese translations.

Uploaded assets end up under the `myproject/web/uploads/assets/` directory.
This means that when you want to include them in a template with, for
instance, an `image_tag()`, you must use an absolute path, as follows:

    [php]
    <?php echo image_tag('/uploads/assets/path_to_asset.suffix') ?>

Interface with the `sfThumbnailPlugin`
--------------------------------------

If the sfThumbnailPlugin is installed in your project, `sfMediaLibrary` will
automatically use it to create thumbnail images of the images you upload. To
deactivate this behavior, change the following setting in the `app.yml`:

    [yml]
    all:
      sf_media_library:
        use_thumbnails: true
        thumbnails_dir: thumbnails

By default, thumbnail images are stored under a `thumbnail/` subdirectory of
the image directory. You can change the name of this directory through another
setting of the `app.yml`:

    [yml]
    all:
      sf_media_library:
        thumbnails_dir: thumbnail
